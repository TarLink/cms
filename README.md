This is a project for a simple, personal CMS. It is my first open-source project in PHP.

Key features added so far:

-responsive design
-protection from DDoS, SQL injection, Rainbow Tables
-integration of PhotoShow gallery https://github.com/thibaud-rohmer/PhotoShow
and TinyMCE text editor
-use of javascript, e.g. MutationObservers to make TinyMCE Image plugin talk to PhotoShow
